I find a platform, called Leetcode, to practice coding im my space time.
Here are the source files in Python that I wrtie for each problem.
To run these files, you must have been installed some Python libs, such as
numpy, pandas... And for my visitors, in each file, I have added some hints to help you understand my code. If there are some mistakes you find in my codes, please contact me at never_say_never@sjtu.edu.cn, and thank you.
