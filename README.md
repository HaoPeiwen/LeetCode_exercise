![avatar](../Img/leetcode.png)
- I find a platform, called Leetcode, to practice coding im my space time.
- Here are the source files in Python that I wrtie for each problem.
- To run these files, you must have been installed some Python libs, such as
numpy, pandas... For my visitors, in each file, I have added some hints to help you understand my code. If there are some mistakes you find in my codes, please contact me at never_say_never@sjtu.edu.cn or ycqsjtu@gmail.com, and thank you.
